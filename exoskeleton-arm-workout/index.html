<p>In 2022, you can wear an actual exoskeleton designed for workouts, a fact that still blows my mind, even after giving this tech a try. It’s a subject that has captivated [kristjan berce] since at a young age seeing his grandmother struggling with lifting, and he presents a working powered exoskeleton arm as a proof of his ideas. The developed exoskeleton device (exorn) has ten degrees of freedom to control joints starting from shoulder griddle to wrist to provide better redundancy, portability, and flexibility to the human arm motion. According to its inventors, this robotic exoskeleton, comprised of a legs and arms support system, can lift around 200 pounds without breaking a sweat and preventing injuries for its operators, who will. titan arm assistive exoskeleton wins 2013 james dyson award.</p>
