<p>Fe fit was the workout i replaced piyo with and do not regret it. While it may seem familiar to those that enjoy the benefits of pilates or yoga, this is a much faster paced workout, due to the incorporation of cardio. The next time you're going through one of the piyo workouts, have a pair of light hand weights on hand so that as you're going through some of the moves you can add the weight to the movement. There was a lot of body resistance involved which will definitely help sculpt the entire body. Piyo Workout Download Free WorkoutWalls.</p>
